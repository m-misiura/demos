## Deployment

Set environment variables with your LLM and guardrail credentials:
```bash
export LLM_API_BASE="https://your-llm-endpoint.com/v1"
export LLM_MODEL_NAME="your-model-name"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

export INJECTION_GUARD_API_BASE="https://your-injection-guard-endpoint.com/v1"
export INJECTION_GUARD_MODEL_NAME="your-injection-guard-model"
export INJECTION_GUARD_API_KEY="your-injection-guard-api-key"

export HAP_GUARD_API_BASE="https://your-hap-guard-endpoint.com/v1"
export HAP_GUARD_MODEL_NAME="your-hap-guard-model"
export HAP_GUARD_API_KEY="your-hap-guard-api-key"
```

Deploy with envsubst (specify which variables to substitute):
```bash
envsubst '${LLM_API_BASE} ${LLM_MODEL_NAME} ${LLM_API_KEY} ${INJECTION_GUARD_API_BASE} ${INJECTION_GUARD_MODEL_NAME} ${INJECTION_GUARD_API_KEY} ${HAP_GUARD_API_BASE} ${HAP_GUARD_MODEL_NAME} ${HAP_GUARD_API_KEY}' < nemo-config.yaml | oc apply -f -
oc apply -f nemo-deployment.yaml
```

## Testing

Get the route URL:
```bash
NEMO_ROUTE=$(oc get route nemo-lemonade -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo "NeMo Guardrails URL: http://$NEMO_ROUTE"
```

### Test 1: Normal lemon question (should pass all guardrails)

They also contain flavonoids, which may contribute to heart health by helping to lower blood pressure. The citric acid and pectin in lemons aid digestion and can promote regular bowel movements. Lemons have diuretic properties that can help with fluid retention. Additionally, the aroma of lemon has been shown to have a refreshing and mood-boosting effect, potentially reducing stress levels. The high potassium content in lemons may help to balance electrolytes in the body. The compounds in lemon can also aid in detoxification by stimulating digestive enzymes and bile production, which helps cleanse the body. They may also have antimicrobial properties that help fight bacteria and viruses. Looking at these benefits, it is advisable to consume lemon in moderation to gain health advantages without overexposure to its acidity.",
